# NP-Complete Puzzle - Sudoku 

# Instructions

To run you can use python3 sudoku.py

The game will display instructions along with the board. 

The user can enter a command to place a number, toggle the helper, or use an auto solver. 

To place a number use the coordinates followed by the number: Ex. "1, 1, 8" will place 8 in the 1st row, 1st column.

To toggle the helper, which prevents you from making mistakes use "Helper".

To use the auto solve feature, use "Solve". 

# Notes

This was meant to be an exploration of an NP-Complete puzzle problem, in this case, Sudoku. The program uses a class to set up the board and methods withing that class to
alter game state, place numbers, detect complete and correct solutions, and solve the puzzle for the user. 

Analysis of the solver and verifcation algorithms can be found in the write up.
